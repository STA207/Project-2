# Introduction


## Background

The Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) was a four-year longitudinal class-size study funded by the Tennessee General Assembly and conducted by the State Department of Education. Over 7,000 students from kindergarten to 3rd grade in 79 schools were randomly assigned into one of three interventions: small class (13 to 17 students per teacher), regular class (22 to 25 students per teacher), and regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students with a full-time teacher's aide). Classroom teachers were also randomly assigned to the classes they would teach. The interventions were initiated as the students entered school in kindergarten and continued through third grade.    

The STAR experiment was designed by a group of researchers including Helen Pate-Bain, the driving force behind Project STAR, other academics, and members of the Tennessee Department of Education. Some of its key features are: 

1. *All Tennessee schools with K-3 classes were invited to participate.* Giving every school a chance to join the study helped ensure a diverse sample as well as rule out the possibility that class-size effects could be attributed to selection bias.   

2. *Each school included in the study had to have a large enough student body to form as least one of each of the three class types.* The within-school design provided built-in control for differences among schools in terms of resources, leadership, and facilities.   

3. *Schools from inner-city, urban, suburban and rural locations were included in the experiment.* This feature guaranteed that samples would include children from various ethnic backgrounds and income levels.   

4. *Students and teachers were randomly assigned to their class type.*    

5. *Investigators followed the standard procedures for confidentiality in human subjects' research.*   

6. *No children were to receive fewer services than normal because of the experiment.*    

7. *Student achievement was to be tracked by standarized tests, which were carefully monitored.*   


## Questions of Interest

To expand on our previous findings, we will set teachers as the experimental unit. Unlike our past research, which focused on the scores of an individual student, we will now consider the classroom average and classroom minimum scaled math scores of each first-grade teacher .  The modified variable of interest will, in theory, stabilize the variability in our data and provide us with better conditions to make inferences regarding the effect of classroom size on a teacher's performance. 

Our questions of interest are as follows:

1. Is there a significant difference in a first-grade teacher's average and minimum math scores across the three different class sizes?

2. Are teacher's performances relatively stable between different schools? That is, does the school itself affect class average math scores?

3. Does our ANOVA model fit well with the data? In other words, are the assumptions for anova satisfied? 

4. Can we conclude that class sizes affect the performacne of first-grade teachers?
